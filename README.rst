A radiocarbon analysing library
-------------------------------

pyC14 is a set of classes and methods dedicated to radiocarbone data analysis.

The project is based on few remarks :
 1. it is very difficult to handle OxCal data and graphs
 2. there are almost no open source software availlable for radiocarbone data calibration and analysis
 3. most of the used softawre are blackbox, not always well-documented and most often deprecated

Based on these constations and my strong "good opinion" on "python" I started to develope my own code.
Part of this code (plotting) is freely inspired from 
the `IOSACal </http://c14.iosa.it/en/latest/#>`_ software, and 
I strongly recommand to have a look at what they do (and 
encourage them to continu).
